Vectorization simply is the act of substituting 'for' and 'while' loops when possible for a one liner with vectors and matrices.

--->Simple example:
You have a vector 'v' and want to add 1 to every element. Instead of looping through the vector, you write:

v = v + 1



---> Or if you have that h(x)= theta * x
Instead of looping through theta and multiplying by x, you make a vector with it:

theta T (Transpose) * x = h(x)
