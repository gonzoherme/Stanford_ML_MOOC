*multiplication

/division

^to the power of

= equals

~= not equals

sqrt square root

%% "." refers to operations element wise

   A * B = a matrix
   A .* B = a matrix, but each element of A was multiplied times its respective element in B

   A .^2  %the square of each element in A

   1 ./ v  %the division of 1 divided by each element in the vector v

   v .+ 1 %adding 1 to each element in vector v

log(v)  %logarithm of each element in vector v

abs(v)  %absolute value of each element in vector v
  abs([-1;2;-3]) = 1 2 3

-v == -1 * v

* Variables
a = 5
c =  (3>=1)






* Matrices
   A = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6]
Each interval separated by ";" is a row of the matrix

To quickly create matrices:
   A = ones(1,3) %creates a 1 row by 3 column matrix full of ones
   A = zeros(1,3) % same thing as previous example but with zeros

   A = rand(3,3) % creates a 3 by 3 matrix with random integers from 0 to 1



eye(n): used to create an identity matrix. N are the number of columns and rows

size(A): tells you the dimensions of the matrix in matrix format
     size(A,1): gives you the number of rows
     size(A,2): gives you the number of columns

A'   %transposed matrix A
A^-1  %transposed matrix A

pinv(A)  % inverse matrix A, CAREFUL, inverse not the same as transposed

flipud(A)  %flips vertically the matrix A

* Vectors
  v = [1; 2; 3] %but you can also write it as [1 2 3]


To quickly create vectors:
    v = 1:1:6 (vector from 1 through 6 at intervals of 1)
    So this automatically creates a vector. Each row is a value from 1(first 
number) to 6 (last numbers), getting there by intervals of 1 (number in the
middle)


length(v): gives you the n of rows


* Graphing

Histogram: hist(variable, ncolumns you want) %ncolumns is optional
