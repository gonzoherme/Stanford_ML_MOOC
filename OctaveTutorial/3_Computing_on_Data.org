max(a) %the maximum value of that vector

max(A, [], 1)  %the maximum value of each column in the matrix A. The 1 means first dimension of A (which are the columns)

+ max(A, [], 1) == max(A)


max(A, [], 2)  %the maximum value of each row in the matrix A. The 2 means second dimension of A (which are the rows)


[x,y] = max(a)  % 'x' is the max value in vector 'a' and 'y' is the position/index of that value

max(A)  %it returns the max values of each column of the matrix

a = [1;2;3];
a < 3
   1 1 0   %(true, true, false)

find(a<3)  %returns the positions of the values in vector a that are below 3

A = [8 1 6; 3 5 7; 4 9 2;]
[r,c] = find(A >=7)
r = [1 3 2]  c = [1 2 3] (r are the rows of A and c the columns)

sum(a) %returns sum of all elements in a 
prod(a) %returns product of all elements in a

sum(A,1) %sums all the values of each column of the matrix
sum(A,2) %sums all the values of each row of the matrix

floor(a) %rounds downwards all elements in a
ceil(a)  %rounds upwards all elements in a
