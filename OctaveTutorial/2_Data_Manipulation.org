* Loading data
Through 'cd', from the octave command line go to where the data file is and type:

load filename %octave will create a variable and assign the files data to it

save data.mat x  %creates file (in binary) data.mat and saves into it the contents of variable x (if you delete all variables and then load data.mat, x will be a variable if you type who)

save data.txt x -ascii  %saves x into data.txt file in human readable format


** Commands

who: to see what variables octave has stored at the moment
whos: lists current variables and details about them (size, memory...)

clear variablename: deletes variable from octave
clear: deletes all variables from octave

x = v(1:10)  % if v was a vector, x would be equal to the first 10 rows of x




* Manipulating data

A = matrix

**** Dealing with the elements
A(3, 2)  %the element in the third row and second column of matrix A
A(2, :)  or A(:,1)...   % ":" means every element in that row/column
A([1 3],:)  %elements from first and third row, all columns

A(:, 2) = [10; 11; 12]  %the second column of A now is [10;11;12]

A = [A, [1; 4; 9]]   %to the matrix A, append row [1,4,9]

A(:)  %put all elements of A into a single vector

C = [A B] or C = [A, B]  %C is the matrix of the concatenation of A and B side by side
C = [A; B]  %same as previous example but instead of side by side, one on top of the other
